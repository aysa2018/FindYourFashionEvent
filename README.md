# Project Title: Vogue Fashion Scraper and Ticketmaster Events Matcher

## Project Description

This project scrapes fashion-related headlines from Vogue’s website and retrieves fashion-related events using the Ticketmaster API. The goal is to find connections between Vogue's fashion articles and upcoming fashion events across the U.S. and provide meaningful insights through visualizations.

The data pipeline includes:
1. Scraping Vogue’s fashion page for headlines, links, and images using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
2. Fetching fashion-related events from Ticketmaster using their public API.
3. Matching Vogue’s headlines with Ticketmaster events based on common keywords.
4. Visualizing the results, including the number of fashion events per city, the distribution of events over time, and matched fashion articles with events by city.

## Project Structure


### Key Libraries Used:
- `sys`: For system path management.
- `time`: To control the wait time for web scraping.
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to Ticketmaster's API.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and storage.
- `matplotlib`: For generating visualizations.
- `selenium`: For web scraping with a headless browser.
- `BeautifulSoup`: For HTML parsing and extracting data from Vogue's webpage.

### Project Flow:
1. **Web Scraping Vogue Fashion Page**:
   - Uses Selenium WebDriver to scrape Vogue's fashion page, extracting headlines, links, and images of articles.
   - The data is stored in a Pandas DataFrame and saved to `vogue_data.csv`.

2. **Fetching Events from Ticketmaster API**:
   - Makes a GET request to Ticketmaster's API, retrieving fashion-related events.
   - The retrieved data is parsed into a Pandas DataFrame and saved to `ticketmaster_events.csv`.

3. **Matching Vogue Headlines with Events**:
   - A matching function compares keywords from Vogue's headlines to Ticketmaster's event names.
   - Matched data is stored in a Pandas DataFrame and saved to `matched_fashion_events.csv`.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Three visualizations are provided:
     1. Bar chart of the number of fashion events per city.
     2. Line chart showing the distribution of fashion events over time.
     3. Bar chart of matched Vogue headlines with Ticketmaster events by city.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files.
2. **Install the required libraries** by running:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium requests pandas beautifulsoup4 matplotlib click
   ```
3. **Download ChromeDriver** to enable Selenium's headless browser. Place the executable in the correct path based on your system configuration.

4. **Run the script** using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. **API Key Setup**: Ensure you have your Ticketmaster API key in .env file:
   ```python
   API_KEY = "Your_Ticketmaster_API_Key"
   ```
### Value of the Dataset

The dataset generated by this project provides a unique combination of fashion trends from **Vogue** with real-time fashion events from **Ticketmaster**. This merged dataset can provide significant value in several ways:

1. **Fashion Event Discovery**: Users, particularly fashion enthusiasts and professionals, will be able to discover upcoming fashion events that align with current trends in the industry. By linking headlines from one of the most influential fashion platforms (Vogue) with real-world events, the dataset creates a seamless bridge between digital fashion content and in-person experiences. This could be especially useful for:
   - Fashion marketers planning event promotions based on trends.
   - Fashion designers who want to align their upcoming showcases with trending topics.
   - Enthusiasts and influencers looking to attend events aligned with the latest fashion articles.

2. **Trend Forecasting and Event Planning**: The dataset can also provide insights for forecasting future trends. By analyzing which topics from Vogue are frequently associated with fashion events, users can gauge which trends are becoming popular in the event scene. This is valuable for event organizers and brands, as they can plan their events around these insights, ensuring maximum relevance to current trends.

3. **Geo-Targeted Fashion Insights**: The dataset allows users to view city-specific events connected to fashion trends. Users can explore which cities are hosting events that match specific trends, providing geographic insights into the fashion industry’s reach and impact. This is helpful for fashion professionals who might want to target their campaigns in cities where specific fashion trends are active or emerging.

4. **Customized Trend Exploration**: Users can explore matched Vogue headlines and events based on keywords they find relevant. This personalization enables them to follow niche trends and events within the fashion industry that would otherwise be difficult to find without hours of manual searching across multiple platforms.

### Why Such a Dataset is Not Publicly Available for Free

1. **Complexity of Data Aggregation**: The dataset combines two distinct sources—Vogue’s fashion trends and Ticketmaster’s event listings—using real-time scraping and API calls. This type of data aggregation is complex and requires specialized techniques like web scraping and API integration, which can be both resource-intensive and legally sensitive. Aggregating data from multiple sources and presenting it in a clean, usable format requires continuous effort and maintenance, which is why such a dataset is typically not freely available.

2. **Proprietary Nature of Data**: Both **Vogue** and **Ticketmaster** maintain proprietary data, especially regarding event listings and high-value content related to fashion trends. While this data is publicly viewable on their respective platforms, creating a unified dataset that integrates trends with real-world events would require access to both their proprietary systems, which is not readily offered as a free service.

3. **Monetization of Data**: Companies like Ticketmaster and Vogue likely prefer to monetize their data through partnerships, event promotion deals, or premium APIs, making such data difficult to access for free in an aggregated format. Their business models often revolve around controlling how data is distributed and who has access, especially when it comes to high-demand sectors like fashion and events.

4. **Dynamic Nature of Data**: Fashion trends and events change frequently, meaning any such dataset would need regular updates to maintain its relevance. Building and maintaining this kind of dataset in real time requires significant technical infrastructure, which makes it less likely to be offered freely by those who have the capability to generate it.

By creating this dataset, we offer a unique, real-time snapshot of fashion trends and events that is not publicly available due to the technical complexity, proprietary restrictions, and high maintenance costs associated with such data.
